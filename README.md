Introduction :
Plant Disease Prediction is Deep Learning based project for predicting plant diseases and providing remedies over it. It utilizes
CNN models to trained on a diverse dataset of plant images to accurately classify and predict the presence of diseases in various
crop species. The website provides an intutive interface for users to upload images of plant leaves and receive real-time disease
prediction, along with information on disease types and potential treatments.

Abstract :
Modern farming practises have the potential to feed the world´s 7.6 billion inhabitants.
Despite the availability of sufficient food, individuals continue to suffer from
malnutrition. Plant diseases reduce both the amount and the quality of total production.
Building an image processing model for prediction or classification applications
presents several obstacles. We present a deep learning model for illness detection that
makes use of CNN.The project ”Plant Disease Prediction using Deep Learning” aims
to develop a system that can accurately predict the diseases affecting plants based
on images of their leaves. The system uses a deep learning model to extract features
from the images and classify them based on the disease. The dataset used for training
and testing the model consists of images of various plants and their leaves affected by
different diseases. In this project, we analyze CNN for tomato, apple, cherry, corn,
grape, orange, peach, pepper, potato, squash, strawberry plant disease datasets. This
project aims to develop a deep learning model that can accurately predict plant diseases
using images of plant leaves. The proposed model utilizes convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) to learn the features of the input images and classify them into
different disease categories. The dataset used for training and testing the model consists
of thousands of labeled images of diseased and healthy plant leaves. The trained
model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. The project
also includes a web-based interface that allows users to upload images of plant leaves
and receive predictions about whether they are healthy or diseased. This project
has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of plant disease
diagnosis and treatment, leading to increased crop yields and reduced food waste.

Technology Used :
Python : For training and testing Deep Learning Models.
NodeJs : Node. js to create server-side web applications.
ReactJs : React is a front-end JavaScript library. React is capable of making API calls (sending the request to the backend), which deal with the data.
